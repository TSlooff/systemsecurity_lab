    "The first two exercises concerns an example situation where course staff require students to disclose whether they have cheated on the final exam of the course. Naturally there is a conflict of interest here, students don't want their answers to be personally identifiable for fear of repercussions, and course staff want useful aggregate statistics.\n",

In this first part we build a toy dataset of student answers and implement central and local differential privacy methods.
