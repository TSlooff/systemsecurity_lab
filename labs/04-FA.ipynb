For every given ciphertext differential we need to calculate back what the Sbox output *differential* is.

    "- Secondly, we use the specific Sbox differentials above to determine what the input state is. We *know* that exactly one bit of the input state was flipped, giving us the specific Sbox output differentials we determined above. What we need to do now is determine for which state it is possible that flipping a single bit gives us the corresponding Sbox output differentials. This can be done as following: We start with a set of all possible states called `L`. For each Sbox output differential, we go through all possible input states. If there is a singular bitflip on that input state which results in the current Sbox output differential, then we add it to a *second* set of possible states called `M`. When we considered all the input states we make `L` into the intersection of `L` and `M`. After repeating this step for all Sbox output differentials we should have only one remaining possible input state in `L`.\n",
